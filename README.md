# COSO
Containerization Oriented Standard Operations


*In Italian, the word "coso" is an informal term that is used to refer to a thing, object, or an unspecified item. It is often used when the specific name or term for something is not known or forgotten. It can also be used as a placeholder word when referring to a person whose name you can't remember or don't want to mention. In English, "coso" can be loosely translated as "thingy," "whatchamacallit," or "doodad."*

## Aim

COSO is mainly a study project to apply teachings on Linux containers internals.
In the long run, the project should evolve in a Docker-like CLI capable of reading configurations files and spin up containers according to the given instructions.
